Hardware:
1.	Power up Arduino_Master with 12V adapter; V
2.	Label different Arduino with correct name; V
3.	Use two-position toggle switch for flush and label flush side with ‘Flush’; V
4.	Change the position of FB motor according to the default value we set (e.g., 30, instead of 0 as before) 
5.	Add the diodes to Solenoids control circuits(2 for rewards and 1 for pole). 


Arduino_Master:
1.	If SD card is not presented, pause the system; V
2.	Add module to send last-24-hour data from SD card; V(implemented, needs tens of seconds)
3.	Read parameter files every time Rocker switch ON, so that when changing a SD card, reset is not necessary; V
4.	Additional parameter for final position for FB motor, and will be updated by GUI; V
5.	Change parameter files into human-readable text file (instead of a binary file); V
6.	Separate reward size for left and right, and add mechanism for receiving reward size info from GUI; V
7.	Record events for user updating parameters from GUI; V
8.	Store weight data in SD card; V


Matlab GUI:
1.	Delete all the data once the COM port is closed V
2.	Add additional panel for updating reward size on Arduino (and also add a ‘reward’ button); V
3.	Add ‘read’ button for the motor position and automatically update motor position when a cage is selected; “move” BF final position. V
4.	Periodically (every second) check COM port, if not available, disconnect it. V
5.	Add ‘tare’ weighting stage button; read threshold values; read the weight; V
6.  Remove the weight info display; V
7.	add user option to pull data from SD card or plot data accumulated in Matlab V


Documentation:
1.	Input/output table for the cage;
2.	Including pictures with pins/boards labeled;
3.	Including folder path when talking about files
4.	Add ‘how to upload Arduino program’
5.	Create a ‘test’ folder for all files used only for test;
6.	Explain state machine is coded in Arduino_Master;
7.	Add instructions for first-time use, daily maintain, changing SD card, changing mouse, pull data from SD card;
8.	Explain datafiles in SD card and provide example script to read these files;
