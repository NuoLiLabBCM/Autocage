GUI saves the progress locally. GUI do not refresh when disconnecting. If connecting to a new GUI window using a previously used mouse name, 
the program pick up the progress from the previous box connected to GUI. Progress should be tied to the SD card, not to the board. GUI should 
follow SD card. GUI should have NO MEMORY
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

For a new mouse, in protocol 0, the program runs well when connected to the GUI. However, when GUI is disconnected, the programm stops running.

Without plugging into GUI, plug in SD card with "final config files". Hit reset, program does not run normally standalone. However, it works
well when connecting to GUI.
    Due to noise when power is plugged in, triggering false 'early licks'.

Motor position not updated on GUI when plugged in. Motor position should be updated whenever a cage is selected.
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

When plugging in SD card, user should hit 'reset', otherwise the system will run previously saved variables,
which produces a range of weird behaviors
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

Documentation of Testing should include a brief instruction on how to upload Arduino program that include the 
following information:
1) Where to install Arduino program
2) install Arduino Due board from "Tool"
3) they need to select Arduino Due, be plugged into the programing port, and select the correct PORT 
4) The user needs to copy the provided library into the library of Arduino program.
5) A brief instruction on how to open RealTerm and connect to the Arduino (Note that when running RealTerm, 
   Arduino needs to be plugged into regular port, NOT programming port.

There are a lot of cross talk between the two lickport, particularly when there is water (e.g. touching right port
triggers a transient <2ms signal in the left). 
	Hardware change required: 
		1) increase the capacitance of the lickport circuit detecting contact
		2) make sure trimmer resistors on the lickometer is set to max
	Documentation change required:
		1) include testing with oscilloscope into the test document.

(Please move the items above to below once fixed).

Without SD card, the system is running some sort of statemachine. It should be stationary
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)
