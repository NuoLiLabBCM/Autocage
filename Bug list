Without SD card, the system is running some sort of statemachine. It should be stationary
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

When plugging in SD card, user should hit 'reset', otherwise the system will run previously saved variables,
which produces a range of weird behaviors
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

There are a lot of cross talk between the two lickport, particularly when there is water (e.g. touching right port
triggers a transient <2ms signal in the left). We need to change either the hardware and software to make the lick
detection more robust.
1) Hardware change: increase the capacitance of the lickport circuit detecting contact
2) Software change: We need to change the Arduino_Task on how PortIn is triggered. Currently a transient change 
will trigger. We need to alter the following portion of the code by adding more than one timestep to the history.
PortIn should be triggered 
			// Determine port entry events
			if ((PortInputLineValue[x] == HIGH) && (PortInputLineLastKnownStatus[x] == LOW)) {
				PortInputLineLastKnownStatus[x] = HIGH;
				CurrentEvent[nCurrentEvents] = Ev;
				nCurrentEvents++;
			}

Without plugging into GUI, plug in SD card with "final config files". Hit reset, program does not run normally standalone. However, it works
well when connecting to GUI.
    Due to noise when power is plugged in, triggering false 'early licks'.

For a new mouse, in protocol 0, the program runs well when connected to the GUI. However, when GUI is disconnected, the programm stops running.

Motor position not updated on GUI when plugged in. Motor position should be updated whenever a cage is selected.
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

GUI saves the progress locally. GUI do not refresh when disconnecting. If connecting to a new GUI window using a previously used mouse name, 
the program pick up the progress from the previous box connected to GUI. Progress should be tied to the SD card, not to the board. GUI should 
follow SD card. GUI should have NO MEMORY
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

Version 1.0
If a cage is connect to matlab GUI. Then disconnect from the GUI and USB. Cage will be stuck. 
When in this state, loading new programs onto SD card won’t update. The cage is completely stuck

Documentation of Testing should include a brief instruction on how to upload Arduino program that include the 
following information:
1) Where to install Arduino program
2) install Arduino Due board from "Tool"
3) they need to select Arduino Due, be plugged into the programing port, and select the correct PORT 
4) The user needs to copy the provided library into the library of Arduino program.
5) A brief instruction on how to open RealTerm and connect to the Arduino (Note that when running RealTerm, 
   Arduino needs to be plugged into regular port, NOT programming port.

1)The version 1.0 system run for a few hours and stopped running. 
2)When clicking "close" button in HomeCage_GUI to close the COM port, sometime Matlab was not responding (stuck).
User has to reset the Arduino_Master in order to get out of the above issues.
it seems that the issues are casued by the commuication between PC and arduino.
