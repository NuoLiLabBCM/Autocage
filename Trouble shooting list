On day 1 of a new mouse in autocage, protocol number jumps unusually from 0 to 3 after few trials, sometimes accompanied by motor retraction issue.
This happened once when the white button in wave board was accidentally touched by air tube. In other cases, no obivous reasons were identified yet.
Fixing often need redo protocol burning to Arduino master card and copying of initial files to SD cards.

Only <100 trials per day, especially during day2 to day7 in autocage.
Some mice might be more timid than others. The pole movement might scare these mice away. If common possibilities were excluded (e.g. lickport positions are
inappropriate, Manual 5.7; there's mechnical glitch on motors Manual 6.2), one may consider stop pole movement (turn off manual air regulator) for one or two days.
Once mice get used to head fixtion, the pole could be brought back (see cage8, mouse id WY378). But this is still an ongoing problem.



====================== Resolved =============================
(Please move the items above to below once fixed).

A series of empty circles in a row in homecage GUI (not those programmed empty circles showing up hourly before headfixation stage) - no licking detection. 
This is sometimes due to the default setting of maximum resistance on lickometer(s). Lower resistance usually fixes the problem (counterclock wise).
Also check that the battery voltage is >8 volt.

Mice could develop strong bias during learning even both lickports dispense similar amount of water, which can't be corrected by programms in time.
Try moving lickports back to center of lickports (70 by default).

SD card read/write errors in "error message" box.
There is a slide switch along the side of SD cards. Repeated removal/insertion of SDs could lead to misalignment of the switch. 
Make sure the switch is pushed to the end of slot to fully "unlocked" state.
It's a good habit to click "set&reward" whenever a SD card is moved or a new mouse is started. An error message would show up if something is wrong.

During analysis, the first date when a new mouse starts might be wrong.
This is likely due to failure to reset the Arduino board on the day1. In this case, the date of 1st trial (Trials.txt) could be used to replace
the first date in Events.TXT.

Without SD card, the system is running some sort of statemachine. It should be stationary
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

When plugging in SD card, user should hit 'reset', otherwise the system will run previously saved variables,
which produces a range of weird behaviors
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

There are a lot of cross talk between the two lickport, particularly when there is water (e.g. touching right port
triggers a transient <2ms signal in the left). We need to change either the hardware and software to make the lick
detection more robust.
1) Hardware change: increase the capacitance of the lickport circuit detecting contact
2) Software change: We need to change the Arduino_Task on how PortIn is triggered. Currently a transient change 
will trigger. We need to alter the following portion of the code by adding more than one timestep to the history.
PortIn should be triggered 
			// Determine port entry events
			if ((PortInputLineValue[x] == HIGH) && (PortInputLineLastKnownStatus[x] == LOW)) {
				PortInputLineLastKnownStatus[x] = HIGH;
				CurrentEvent[nCurrentEvents] = Ev;
				nCurrentEvents++;
			}

Without plugging into GUI, plug in SD card with "final config files". Hit reset, program does not run normally standalone. However, it works
well when connecting to GUI.
    Due to noise when power is plugged in, triggering false 'early licks'.

For a new mouse, in protocol 0, the program runs well when connected to the GUI. However, when GUI is disconnected, the programm stops running.

Motor position not updated on GUI when plugged in. Motor position should be updated whenever a cage is selected.
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

GUI saves the progress locally. GUI do not refresh when disconnecting. If connecting to a new GUI window using a previously used mouse name, 
the program pick up the progress from the previous box connected to GUI. Progress should be tied to the SD card, not to the board. GUI should 
follow SD card. GUI should have NO MEMORY
    (this will be fixed in version 1.0 update)

Version 1.0
If a cage is connect to matlab GUI. Then disconnect from the GUI and USB. Cage will be stuck. 
When in this state, loading new programs onto SD card won’t update. The cage is completely stuck

Documentation of Testing should include a brief instruction on how to upload Arduino program that include the 
following information:
1) Where to install Arduino program
2) install Arduino Due board from "Tool"
3) they need to select Arduino Due, be plugged into the programing port, and select the correct PORT 
4) The user needs to copy the provided library into the library of Arduino program.
5) A brief instruction on how to open RealTerm and connect to the Arduino (Note that when running RealTerm, 
   Arduino needs to be plugged into regular port, NOT programming port.

1)The version 1.0 system run for a few hours and stopped running. 
2)When clicking "close" button in HomeCage_GUI to close the COM port, sometime Matlab was not responding (stuck).
User has to reset the Arduino_Master in order to get out of the above issues.
it seems that the issues are casued by the commuication between PC and arduino.
