# Autocage
A home-cage system for fully autonomous mouse behavioral and optogenetic experiments
## Features
- Automated home-cage training in challenging decision-making tasks with voluntary head-fixation
- Unsupervised optogenetic experiment to survey brain regions involved in behavior
- Running standalone, with GUI monitoring multiple parallel systems
- Protocols for automated training in voluntary head-fixation, delayed response task, and contingency reversals
